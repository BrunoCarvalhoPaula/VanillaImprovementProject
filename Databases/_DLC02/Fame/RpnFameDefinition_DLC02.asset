    Leverage
    from renouncing grievances source:

    Target.EraLevel * 0.15 serves as the
    "grievance generation intensifier" over eras

    10 is the estimated average
    amount of grievances (data-backed)

    5 is the current Leverage value of renouncing
    one Grievance


    Leverage from collecting Intel (low):

    Target.EraLevel
    * 0.15 serves as the "grievance generation intensifier" over eras

    10 is
    the estimated average amount of grievances (data-backed)

    10 (when * by thirdpartyrelationships)
